### Architecture overview

![System Design](/documentation-resources/scout24-git-system-design.jpg)

### Discuss Topics

- Comsuming external apis from backend or frontend?
- How can we manage other git providers? (bitbucket,bitlocker)

### TODO

- Improve logging. Logging API, NoSql, Streaming, Notifications etc.
- Organize cache logic, expire times etc.
- Better ui design. For simplicity i put follower, following users to dashboard but it seems odd. Better analyze of needs and improve ui design
- Design CD pipelines, docker containers, kubernetes, Cloud deployment etc.
